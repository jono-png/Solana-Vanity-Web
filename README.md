## Frontend

The frontend of the application is hosted on Vercel and can be easily accessed through the following link: [https://solana-vanity.vercel.app/](https://solana-vanity.vercel.app/). Feel free to visit and explore the interface of our application.

## Backend

For the backend, I'm using Render.com to host it. This setup ensures that our backend is always available and can efficiently handle requests from the frontend, ensuring a smooth user experience.
